 *          method creates/instantiates the datastructures the app is dependant upon
 *              If persistent data is found, that data is used
 *          creates the refresh object
 *              object: refresh
 *                  holds references to individual component state functions to 
 *                      facilitate quick updates
 *         
 * 
 * 		storeLocally  ::  void  ->  model object
