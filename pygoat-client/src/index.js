/*
File: index.js
Description: file defines the View and Controller classes and instantiates them using the imported Model Class
				This is designed based on a fundamental architectural pattern the Model-View-Controller
				The MVC pattern is used client side as opposed to server side to create a Single Page Application
				learn more about this MVC implementation here: https://www.taniarascia.com/javascript-mvc-todo-app/
				
Conventions followed:
				4-space tabs
				always place semicolons
				3 empty lines between classes and functions
				2 empty lines between methods
				Class methods always return this unless other return value desired
				annotations follow the convention:     
						function/method  ::  (parameter types) -> (return types)
